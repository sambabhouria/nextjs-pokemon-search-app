# About

This Next.js frontend web app is a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse and search for Pokemon data from the Pokemon API.
Built with server-side rendering, it delivers fast and reliable performance and enhances SEO.
The app features a search bar that utilizes debounce functionality for efficient searches, and infinite scroll for effortless browsing of large amounts of data.

This app follows the Atomic Design Pattern, which breaks down the interface into smaller, reusable components. These components are built with stitches.dev,
a CSS-in-JS library that provides high-performance styles. The app's state management is powered by Zustand, a lightweight and fast state management
library for React, while its code quality is improved by TypeScript, a statically typed programming language.

Overall, this app provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users to browse and search for Pokemon data.
Its fast performance, responsive design, reusable components, and efficient search and browsing features make it a showcase of the power and flexibility of the Next.js framework.
